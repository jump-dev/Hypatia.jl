### Installation

To use Hypatia, install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/), then at the Julia REPL, type:
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Hypatia")

julia> using Hypatia
```
Hypatia is an experimental solver and a work in progress, and may not run with older releases of Julia.
Default options/parameters are not well-tuned, so we encourage you to experiment with these.

### Usage

Hypatia can be accessed through a low-level native Julia interface or through open-source modeling tools such as [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and [Convex.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl).
The native interface is more expressive, allowing Hypatia to solve conic models expressed with generic real floating point types and structured matrices or linear operators, for example.
However, it is typically sufficient and more convenient to use JuMP.

Using JuMP, we can model a simple D-optimal experiment design problem and call Hypatia:
```julia
using LinearAlgebra
using JuMP
using Hypatia

# setup JuMP model
opt = Hypatia.Optimizer(verbose = false)
model = Model(() -> opt)
@variable(model, x[1:3] >= 0)
@constraint(model, sum(x) == 5)
@variable(model, hypo)
@objective(model, Max, hypo)
V = rand(2, 3)
Q = V * diagm(x) * V'
aff = vcat(hypo, [Q[i, j] for i in 1:2 for j in 1:i]...)
@constraint(model, aff in MOI.RootDetConeTriangle(2))

# solve and query solution
optimize!(model)
termination_status(model)
objective_value(model)
value.(x)
```
See our [D-optimal design](https://github.com/chriscoey/Hypatia.jl/blob/master/examples/doptimaldesign/JuMP.jl) example for more information and references.

Many more examples using the native interface or JuMP can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/chriscoey/Hypatia.jl/tree/master/examples).
